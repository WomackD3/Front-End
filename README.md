1. Accountability through Trello, people take responsibility or ownership of task on Trello however, communication and collaboration is encouraged on individual tasks.

2. Before we make a pull request we communicate together for the code owner to approve it after Simplicity does a thorough review.

3. We pull request at the end of the night, in the morning Womack will approve and communicate approval or potential merge conflicts via slack.  We all pull from that branch at the morning of class.
