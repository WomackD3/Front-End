<h1>Hey We are Simplicity!</h1>

<p>We wanted to create a message board that would interact with the user and the audience.
     By implementing functions such as registration, postability, and thread creation.
     Learning how to code has always been a passion for us, and with the information age came social media.
     This is our take on the social media platform.
